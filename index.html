<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>On this page we propose an experimental process of 'double blind' comparison which consists of giving the same dataset to two network analysts and to confront their methodological choices, results and interpretations. This ‚Äòdouble blind‚Äô approach (Jacomy and Grandjean, 2021) makes it possible to make the intersubjectivity of the process visible and provide empirical material to discuss how the eyes of specialists from different disciplines influence the interpretation of the data. We believe that producing and making explicit such interpretive pathways can help researchers, designers and students understand the diversity of possible approaches.</p>

<h2>The subjectivity of network interpretation in the humanities</h2>
<p>If network analysis is a method now very widely diffused in the field of digital humanities (Ahnert et al., 2020), often because the metaphor and lexical field of ‚Äònetwork‚Äô are very effective in describing the objects of study of the humanities, there is no definitive interpretation procedure. Indeed, describing a network entails the recontextualization of graph-theoretical elements (e.g., the ‚Äúbetweenness centrality‚Äù metric) into the language of the discipline (e.g., ‚Äúknowledge brokers‚Äù or simply ‚Äúbridges‚Äù) through a methodological ‚Äútranslation‚Äù (Grandjean and Jacomy, 2019). This hermeneutic process is subjective by nature, especially in the humanities where visual network analysis is often privileged, which may seem paradoxical considering that the method is supposed to objectify historical or literary sources (this is more generally true for all digital methods). Yet as Popper argued, descriptive statements necessarily draw their validity from ‚Äúintersubjective agreement‚Äù (Freeman, 1973). How much agreement does network analysis offer?</p>

<h2>Experimental process</h2>
<p>To ensure comparability, the phase of individual experimentation is framed by strict constraints in terms of time and tools. A network dataset is prepared upstream and duplicated: the two participants get a time budget of 2 hours to explore the data and produce an annotated network visualization of their choice, possibly including other tables and visualizations, as well as a list of hypotheses on the structure of the graph. This phase is filmed and screencasted. Then the two people discover each other's work and compare their interpretations.</p>
<p>The result of these parallel interpretations is presented as two paths (below) and can be compared by means of an online document integrating the data set, interactive and/or composite visualizations, descriptive text and video sequences making it possible to follow the reasoning. In the end, the data set itself is only a pretext for an educational experiment, the aim of which is as much to confront us with the subjectivity of the interpretation as to show the interest of such an exercise of replication.</p>
